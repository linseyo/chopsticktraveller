	<em>FOOD</em>

		As a food blogger, I'm always on the hunt for the most delicious meal in town or the most "hipster" place to relax at.

		This food + travel blog uses a lot of various DIV tags coupled with IDs and includes a lot of script tags that contain various functions. In my opinion the website is a bit cluttered with too much information, but they did their best to break it up into different sections with the div tag. They also included the use of CSS to give more design to the page but also a few HTML elements of design.
