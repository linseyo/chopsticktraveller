## Description:
Created as a part of my Solo Challenge during the third week of Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp. Phase 0 is the off-site portion of the program that takes students through the basics of HTML, CSS, Basic Web Development and Ruby. By the third week we had just learned about Git, Github, HTML and CSS. This solo challenge was meant to allow us to explore more on how to use CSS and HTML to build a dynamic webpage.
